### Pitch

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would
you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

Serious mtn bike riders are willing to pay to find a single track that is truly a gem. They may also want to keep track of what they have ridden and mark trails that they want to ride in the future.


### Description

Idea 2: Build an app where the mountain bike trails for colorado are all compiled in one place. That way the customer can choose the most direct route possible or base their ride off of mileage. Riders should be able to pick an area and find all trails with associated ride times, drop off areas, and provisional access. I will build a dashboard that will show all of your personal settings. When you ride a trail, you can then log into your account on Make My Ride and rate the trail based on level of difficulty, enjoyment, how long it took you, a target finish time and what your favorite trail is, as well mark some trails that you intend to ride.
You can also ‘like’ a trail on the main page and it will keep a score of how many likes have been submitted from different users and push these trails to the top. When you like a trail it will post to facebook and tell all your friends that you like this trail
